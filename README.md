## Review Classification

This repository contains two projects for review classification: one focusing on restaurant reviews and the other on movie reviews.

### **Restaurant Review Classification**

In this project:

- Imported raw data.
- Implemented stopword removal using NLTK followed by stemming.
- Utilized the Bag of Words model to transform the corpus into vectors.
- Employed the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
- Conducted performance evaluation using various metrics.

### **Movie Review Classification**

In this project:

- Gathered data from multiple sources including Yelp, IMDB, and Amazon.
- Performed stopword removal using Spacy followed by lemmatization.
- Utilized the Bag of Words model to convert the corpus into vectors.
- Employed the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification.
- Conducted performance evaluation using various metrics.

Each project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to text classification, including preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
